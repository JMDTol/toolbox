### Corpora

[corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)

> Corpora is repository of JSON files, meant to be language-neutral. If you want to create an NPM repo or whatever based on this, be my guest, but this repository will remain a collection of data files that can be interpreted by any language that can parse JSON.
Corpora is a collection of small files. It is not meant to be an exhaustive source of anything: a list of resources should contain somewhere in the vicinity of 1000 items.

> For example, Corpora will not contain any complete "dictionary" style files. Instead we host a sampling of 1000 common nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

> Some lists are small enough by nature that we may contain a complete list of things in their category. For example, a list of heavily populated U.S. cities may only have 75 cities and be considered complete.

### OCRAD.js

[OCRAD.js](http://antimatter15.com/ocrad.js/demo.html)
